## Quantum Homomorphic Encryption

#### Timeline

* 22 April - Problem set 4 due
* 6 May - Problem set 5 due
* 6 May - Project presentations begin
* 15 May - Written project due

#### Todo

- [ ] Understand GSW paper (1)
- [ ] Understand Urmila's paper (2)
- [ ] Look at linear optimization algorithm on IBM Q (3)
- [ ] Figure out how classical data interacts with IBM Q

(1) Homomorphic Encruption from Learning with Errors: Conceptually-simpler, Asymptotically-faster, Attribute-based

(2) Classical Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Circuits

(3) Performing Homomorphic Encryption Experiments on IBM's Cloud Quantum Computing Platform
