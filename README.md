#### Description

This repository is an instantiation of Gentry-Sahai-Waters homomorphic encryption that supports integer addition and scaling. This program currently does not support multiplication between two ciphertexts. Please refer to the pdf labeled "GSW Python Encryption" for details about motivation and the algorithm we implemented.

Also included is a demo to prove that a user's data is protected from the party performing the operation.
